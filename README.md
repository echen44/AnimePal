# AnimePal

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/WJxNL05.jpg, "screens")

AnimePal is a WIP Android app to watch the latest anime releases. It is also my first Android app. It uses the MasterAnime API. Everything is very rough and some things are broken but the core functionality is working and videos open up in an external player of your choice.

## What's not working (many things, go easy on me)
* Back Button. I haven't gotten around to taking advantage of the Android lifecycle things yet.
* Some video hosts
* My UI skills
* More things I forgot

## What's coming up
* Searching for a show to watch
* Placeholder images for episodes with no thumbnail.
* Placeholders for images not yet loaded.
* General prettiness
